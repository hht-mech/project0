                <p class="para">Yangon Technological University is one of the best universities in Myanmar and only allows admissions of students who gained high marks from the matriculation examination. A student&#8217;s majorized engineering field is also decided by the marks he earned through the matriculation examination. Currently, YTU possesses 12 Engineering Departments, 6 Supporting Departments, 1 Research Centre and 47 Laboratories. There are currently about 2000 students seeking knowledge and experiences at YTU. The present Yangon Technological University (Y.T.U) began as the Department of Engineering in 1923 under the Rangoon (Yangon) University. The Engineering Department was situated downtown, on the Bogyoke Aung San street. B.Sc. (Engineering) program in Civil Engineering began in 1924. However, in 1972, with the construction of the B.O.C. College of Mining and Engineering in the university estate, the Department of Engineering was moved to that place. The Department was upgraded to become the Faculty of Engineering in 1964 headed by the Dean of Engineering under the Rangoon (Yangon) University.</p>

                    <p class="para"> New academic departments were opened at the B.O.C. College: Mechanical Engineering (1951); Electrical Engineering.(1951); Mining Engineering (1953); Chemical Engineering (1954); Metallurgy (1954); Architecture (1954); Textile Engineering (1955). There were eight Departments at the B.O.C. College by 1955 including Civil Engineering Department. As the scope of Engineering Education became more extensive, a larger complex was constructed at Gyogone in Insein Township and the Faculty of Engineering was moved to that place in 1961. It was called Burma Institute of Technology (B.I.T.), which was later renamed as Rangoon (Yangon) Institute of Technology (R.I.T.) in 1963 and has been known as Yangon Technological University (Y.T.U.) since July 1, 1998.</p>
                    <p class="para">With the introduction of the new education system in 1964, professional institutes were born and R.I.T. was one of them having all the rights and status of a full-fledged University. Direct 6-year B.E. /B.Arch. programmes were initiated. In 1965, the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree was first offered instead of the B.Sc.(Engineering) degree offered while under the Rangoon University. In 1968, Master of Engineering (M.E.) courses were first opened in two Departments only (Civil Engineering. and Chemical Engineering.), eventually in other departments as well. Ph.D. programmes in Engineering and Applied Sciences began in 1997. From 1997 to 2011, new undergraduate students were not admitted at Y.T.U. due to the prevailing circumstances but they were admitted only at the new Universities and Colleges for the new threestep ladder-like technical education system. Only some post-graduate programmes remained at Y.T.U. in that period. However, in 2012, Y.T.U. was reopened for the undergraduate studies and is now offering twelve six-year Bachelor of Engineering/ Architecture undergraduate programmes as well as numerous postgraduate Diploma, Master and Ph.D. programmes in a variety of disciplines, totaling 78 programmes. Nine of the undergraduate programmes are provisionally accredited by FEAIP (Federation of Engineering Institutions in Asia and the Pacific).</p>
